# Roadmap

Ordered by what most improves the one question miras exists to answer:
*can this study design recover these parameters?*

1. **More findings.** `UNDERPOWERED` (how many groups / respondents / waves
   until a parameter is recoverable: the paper's power analysis, generalised
   by sweeping the design) and `MISCALIBRATED` (simulation-based calibration,
   Talts et al. 2018, rather than the single 90% coverage number reported now).
2. **Equifinality beyond pairs.** The current detector examines parameter
   pairs. Ridges involving three or more parameters (e.g. conformity, migration
   and innovation jointly) need the full posterior covariance spectrum.
3. **Summary informativeness.** A `WEAK_SUMMARY` finding saying which
   summaries carry information about which parameters, so designs can be
   pruned as well as extended.
4. **Simulation-based inference backend** (neural posterior estimation via
   `sbi`), for designs where ABC's curse of dimensionality bites.
5. **Longitudinal designs as first-class objects**, not only through the paper
   workflow: panel studies with observed networks, as in Fig. 4.
6. **More learning rules and structures.** Prestige / success bias, guided
   variation and content bias; network population structure.
7. **Speed.** A JAX backend (`vmap` over parameter sets) so reference tables
   of 10^5 simulations become interactive.
8. **Real data adapters**, and a validation study: does a design that miras
   calls identifiable actually recover parameters from real data?
9. Populations of LLM agents as learners, audited with daftar's Concordia
   adapter.
